# Angular 15 demo client for springbootexample (CRUD with Rest API)

Build an Angular 15 CRUD example App to consume Rest APIs, display, modify & search data.

Demo Application in that:
- Each Demo item has id, title, description, published status.
- We can create, retrieve, update, delete Demos.
- There is a Search bar for finding Demos by title. Search runs automatically after typing first 3 chars.

Run `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files (regenerating and reloading main.js and runtime.js).
